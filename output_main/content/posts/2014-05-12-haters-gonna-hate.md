I play badminton often, and a lot of people seem to hate on towel grips, claiming that they're smelly, harder to maintain, and a whole bunch of other reasons. I was like this as well, because in my logical mind, a towel grip should stink compared to a synthetic grip, right? You know what?Â **I never even tried a towel grip before, and I know the same goes for a lot of haters out there.**
