**Day 3 - June 10**

One of greatest life lessons I can offer you - When travelling with a girl, there is bound to be some shopping, even if you had left it out of the itinerary somehow. Second life lesson - Never stop a girl from shopping :P.

For Day 3, we decided to head to La Roca Shopping Village. Sheryl had told me about it just before the trip, and because of the change in the Hot Air Balloon session, we realized that we had time to squeeze this in.

The day started with me waking up to Sheryl doing some housework…

Before the shopping begins, we first needed to get our stomachs filled. We headed to the second place that Tatiana recommended. I think it was called La Pegrella but I can’t find it on Google… :(.

We finally had paella after 3 days in Barcelona :D! The food was really good although it was not as affordable as we hoped, but it’s still worth it anyway!

After that, we spent about an hour looking for the bus that will get us to La Roca Village. In the end, we did not get onto the bus we were looking for (I still have no idea where that bus stop is), but we took the Sagales bus there. This happened as a result of asking a lot of questions to a lot of stall owners, and one of them somehow had [Sagales](http://www.sagales.com/) bus tickets for sale, so we bought a pair of them. They gave us some directions and we managed to find the Sagales bus stop. Either way, we got to La Roca Village!

While on the bus, this happened:

After approximately 40 minutes, we arrived at La Roca Village.

We’re not going to dive into details of what we bought there, but let’s just say that a couple of pretty good deals + Sheryl turns into a pretty deadly combination, which results in this:

![image](/img/2014-07-08-travel-spain-2014-part-3---barcelona-day-3/1251467b68c171ca5b26c05944cc06283d95b4742c0f203a8658309b029aacb6.jpg)

To make matters worse, she decided to have it all in one big luggage, and bought a Samsonite luggage to dump everything inside like a boss:

_Truth: The luggage that she brought to Spain is very, very difficult to wheel around due to some faults._

Anyway, I shopped a little as well, but it’s negligible compared to Sheryl. Oh well :P. Of course, not everything is about shopping at La Roca Village (it is). We had some bites and some random fun:

After all the time spent at La Roca Village, you’d have thought that it was enough, right? No! We headed to the Mango Outlet that is very nearby:

_Hehe. &lt;3_

We finally *phew* headed back to Barcelona via the Sagales bus (return ticket) after this! If I remember correctly, we immediately headed back to the lodging, dumped our stuff, and fell asleep for a while. I believe we reached Barcelona about 8pm.

We woke up sometime around 8.45pm, and decided to head for the Barceloneta Beach. Benoit’s place is about 20 minutes walk away, so we decided to take a nice stroll there as the sun starts to set. Along the way, we bought some “Frit” chips (we could not find it out of Barcelona :() that was super nice!

_Sheryl just keeps eating, and eating…_

_Still eating…_

_See! She’s still holding a chip!_

We finally reached the beach after about 30 minutes, thanks to all the photos we kept taking!

_Yeah, we set foot in the Mediterranean Sea :P!_

_Enough is enough! I shall finish the rest of the chips!_

We decided to end the day at about 10pm and headed back to the lodging. However, before that, we also checked out the tapas place just under our block… and ordered some food!

![image](/img/2014-07-08-travel-spain-2014-part-3---barcelona-day-3/dcb7bd96e323400082073f58b2016db781e2680987a8f0a4cd9750dbe07cc446.jpg)  
_I don’t remember the exact name, but it’s essentially cured anchovies on the right. I actually ate it (I’m not adventurous when it comes to food), and it’s pretty damn good!) On the left is Iberian ham with bread._

![image](/img/2014-07-08-travel-spain-2014-part-3---barcelona-day-3/2830d3c1a3a8dc68a005564d117973067496457f14fc9a293d0dbda71fd170e7.jpg)  
_They do provide some plain bread with tomato to eat the anchovies with!_

We finally headed back for an early rest as our Hot Air Balloon session is the next day, and we have to be up around 5am!

That’s all for day 3! Again, I miscalculated and thought I could fit in days 4 and 5, but I think it’d be better to save them for another post!
