**Day 7 - June 14**

As mentioned in the previous post, we didn’t have much of a plan for Seville. Other than Plaza de Espana, the Seville Cathedral, and the Alcazar, we weren’t sure of what else to do. It was good to slow down the pace a little bit after our crazy-packed itinerary in Barcelona!

Oscar had recommended that we take a walk to the Cathedral and other attractions, and along the way, stop by The Mushroom (Metropol Parasol). It seemed like a good plan, so off we went! We started the day around 10am.

_Stopped at the nearby market and Sheryl bought some cherries._

_We stopped by at Carrefour to get some water (not beer despite the picture :P). Also, we took a Haribo plastic bag so we could wash the cherries even though we didn’t buy any candies… :X_

We soon reached The Mushroom :)!

We decided to first grab some breakfast as we were really hungry! There was a nice little coffee shop just beside The Mushroom, with lots of locals, so we decided to head there.

_We ordered more food :P._

Sheryl also took this opportunity to wash the cherries we had purchased earlier from the market.

We then decided it was time to head up to the top of The Mushroom, but before that, we saw the Antiqvarivm de Sevilla and decided to check it out first. The Antiqvarivm de Sevilla displays the Roman ruins that were excavated in Seville and is located in The Mushroom :P.

We soon headed to the top of The Mushroom! The structure is very wavy and looks amazing in person! I’m not very artistic so that’s as descriptive as I get… :P. Hopefully the following video illustrates this better:

The tickets to the top comes with a coupon that you can use to redeem for a glass of drink at one of the restaurants there, so we promptly headed there for a short break. The weather was hovering around 40°C at this time! We then headed for the Cathedral.

Along the way, Sheryl got sucked into a shop which were selling lots of owl-inspired stuffs…

![image](/img/2014-07-22-travel-spain-2014-part-7---seville-day-2/718df7f680069646be7e19985e7253f807563e28378c866429a0fce7e5d79592.jpg)

_Owl keychain and bag._

For some reason a man cannot fully comprehend, Sheryl was captivated by these little owly things! :P

We soon saw the Cathedral within close range…

![image](/img/2014-07-22-travel-spain-2014-part-7---seville-day-2/c865f549f8ec13bbd442cfd93f368ab417b5444c1c1311ae04bcdbc2fc516bd1.jpg)

There was a queue to buy the tickets and enter the Cathedral. Fortunately, we met a lovely old couple from Ireland whom we had a fun conversation with! They looked like they were in their 80s, and they were still touring Europe in a campervan! Never too old :)! Meeting them made us want to find out more about Ireland (which we did), and now we may want to go there sometime in future! The couple advised us not to go to the Alcazar since we had already seen the one in Cordoba plus we were going to Granada for the Alhambra in a matter of days, and to go for the Plaza de Espana instead.

After around 30 minutes, it was our turn to buy the tickets. We said our goodbyes to the lovely old couple and started our tour of the Cathedral.

We then headed for the Giralda Tower that was located in the Cathedral. Just before that, we caught sight of a wedding that was taking place in the Cathedral!

_Sheryl really liked this outfit! She snapped quite a number of shots, hahaha._

I can’t remember how many steps or rounds we had to go, but we finally made it to the top!

We then made our way down… Surprisingly there were not as many people as there were when we were going up, so we had space to take some photos :).

The Cathedral was very beautiful and well-worth the trip :)! Honestly though, after Barcelona and Cordoba, we were beginning to feel like we have seen too many buildings and monuments, so we decided to take the old couple’s advice and skip the Alcazar, and instead head straight for the Plaza de Espana.

![image](/img/2014-07-22-travel-spain-2014-part-7---seville-day-2/b6cf65c58ec52271a23991f7bed35fbdb64626b4b6f440fa3dfd0b32901833a0.jpg)  
_Small ice-cream that is really good! It’s a little chewy and they’re all fruit-flavoured._

_Sheryl found another owl bag and wanted to buy it for herself! The first owl bag she bought was meant for my younger cousin. Anyway, she ended up taking the first one (blue) and gave the green one away instead, hehe. The blue bag is slightly larger than the green one (was one of the reasons)._

Upon reaching Plaza de Espana, we went for this (had to pay a small amount, I think it was 2 Euros or something):

_I love this shot by Sheryl! However, the reality that was happening was that the busker was actually pestering the couple on the boat to give him money :(._

We then went to the Maria Luisa Park just beside the Plaza de Espana for a short walk.

![image](/img/2014-07-22-travel-spain-2014-part-7---seville-day-2/6701d309a0a78296c1b5224563cbf3b82f83de47e55a9d47702aa86153aaef4b.jpg)

And then it was time to leave…

![image](/img/2014-07-22-travel-spain-2014-part-7---seville-day-2/15af70d989a9f26818f976775b43cccea0adf6c48f798308b5bb5aec01b8f82f.jpg)

It was around 6.30pm at this time, and we have been walking almost non-stop since 10am, so we decided to head back to rest. Along the way, we saw another park with swings, so we headed in for a brief moment before continuing with our walk home.

_Cute cookie monster donut! The blue part is actually coconut._

We fell asleep very quickly once we reached our lodging, and woke up only around 10pm. We then headed out to find some food, as well as a place to watch soccer. However, due to some issues with the lock in Oscar’s place (the place itself was locked, but not the individual rooms and there were multiple tenants), we didn’t feel at ease, so we decided to just have dinner and skip the soccer bit.

We couldn’t find one of the restaurants Oscar recommended, and instead stumbled into this place:

The food was surprisingly good! Even cooler, the owner told us that they were comedian clowns and there’s a play every week or so, but we can’t catch it as we were leaving Seville the next day :(.

![image](/img/2014-07-22-travel-spain-2014-part-7---seville-day-2/d700843f4874cdae0452e09f12d5f6a7dab46aca7c65fa3fa41ff10ebbff7896.jpg)

Do check them out when you’re in Seville! :) After we were done, we headed back to the lodging for a relatively early night. For a day where we started with almost nothing planned, I think we ended up doing a lot of things!

That’s all for now :).
