**Day 6 - June 13**

I initially wanted to head for Archaeological Ensemble of Madinat Al-Zahra to see the ruins, but decided that it’d be better if we slow down a little and just relax for most of the morning :P. We had a train to catch at 4.20pm and only woke up around 11am, so getting to the Madinat Al-Zahra would’ve been a very difficult mission anyway! In addition, we were advised by Maria to take the 11am bus to the Madinat Al-Zahra the day before, and had already missed the timing.

Since we had nothing planned, we decided to just relax…

_Sheryl drinking coffee like a boss._

_Still drinking coffee :P. It’s not often that we get to relax with such a charming backdrop (if I may say so myself :X)._

We decided to head to Bodegas Campos for lunch again, and at the same time, enjoy a slow walk around the city.

_Interesting door handle… A little creepy too._

We reached Bodegas Campos soon enough, and ordered different dishes from the day before (except for one).

_Enchiladas. This was really good._

_Fried cod cubes. I have a phobia of fish bones :X, but this was really tasty and I ate quite a bit of it!_

_Decent salmon. It was actually pretty good, but it pales in comparison to the other dishes :(._

_The ravioli makes a comeback._

After lunch, it was time to head back to our lodging to grab our luggages and make our way to the train station. Xavier had kindly helped us to book a taxi :). Here’s a note that Maria had wrote to us in the morning (which I had not read until I was going to leave), they’re really wonderful hosts:

And off we go! Seville is the 3rd city that we are visiting in Spain.

_In the taxi going to the Cordoba train station…_

The train ride from Cordoba to Seville takes about 1.5 hours, so we will arrive in Seville just before 6pm. As always, we both fell asleep for most of the train ride :P. I actually bought tickets to the Seville-San Bernardo station instead of the Seville-Santa Justa station which we should alight at. Thankfully, San Bernardo is the further one, so we simply alighted a stop earlier. I probably paid a little more than I should have :(. Either way, we arrived at Santa Justa and took a customary shot:

We then headed for our lodging at Oscar’s place. Oscar is another very friendly host :)!

_See [here](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/518382) for the actual room we booked on Airbnb._

We soon got to our room, which was really cool! Oscar builds and designs the places he rents out (I think he’s an interior designer), and the place we had has wooden palettes as the bed frame. They also have wheels installed so you can either split them up for 2 twin beds, or join them up for a double bed. Really cool! There’s also a kitchen, and a terrace…!

Here’s a walkthrough of the lodging:

Oscar then gave us a map and started telling us about his favourite places and how we can go about walking around Seville. He is really enthusiastic when sharing about these things :)!

We did not have much planned for Seville as we had decided to let it be one of the cities where we would explore when we arrive. We headed out once we had rested enough for the Alameda de Hercules neighbourhood, which was less than 5 minutes from our lodging!

_Showing the team they’re supporting for the World Cup? :D_

I have to agree with Oscar, Alameda de Hercules was a really lively and active area. Lots of kids, lots of parents, lots of people just having a good time!

The Spain vs Holland World Cup match was also on this day, so we could see lots of flags everywhere! Lots of kids too, and they were really cute (even though some of them kept blocking the TV, hahaha).

_Just too cute!_

We wanted to watch the match at one of the places, but decided to first have dinner at Casa Paco, one of the places that Oscar recommended…

_The drink on the left is quite literally drinking blended tomato… I can’t remember what it’s called. We didn’t really like it as the taste was very strong, but it was still a good experience :)!_

_Update: Thanks to [@tocoteOvd](https://twitter.com/tocoteOvd) for letting me know! That drink on the left is called Gazpacho._

_Look at that greedy face!!!_

The dinner was quite good, but the one dish that I really liked was the leeks :)! Next up, we had to find a place with seats so we could watch the World Cup match…

Unfortunately, many of these places were already full, as you’d expect, so we had to keep finding. Of course, we finally found one that has seats! Never give up :P.

As we all know, this was also the night that Spain lost to Holland 5 - 1 :(. I am a fan of Spain too, so I was quite sad. In fact, you could feel the sadness in the air, everyone was just down after the match. As luck would have it, we sat beside a table of Dutch folks…

![image](/img/2014-07-20-travel-spain-2014-part-6---cordoba-day-2-seville-day-1/5e40d73bb1b52291143a7bdf181a13846189f5e5ab1511f0f5832979335a9aa6.jpg)  
_See the ones in orange behind me?_

They were probably the only happy people that night in the neighbourhood of Alameda de Hercules :P.

We then walked back to our lodging to rest for the night… And took some photos as always. Seville, and Spain really, is beautiful, even (and/or especially) at night!

That’s all for now! :)
